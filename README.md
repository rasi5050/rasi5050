- 👋 Hi, I’m Rasi
- 👀 I’m interested in backend development. I believe reasoning is the highest form of intelligence and problem solving is the key to it. My efforts are now focused on problem solving and reasoning, controlled randomness, and hence greatness.
If you ever see me contemplating, there is something amazing that's happening in my head, but that should not hinder you from seeking my attention.
- :man_student:	 I’m currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Syracuse University.
- :man_technologist:	I have 4 years of experience as a DevOps/Software Engineer over multiple technologies and domains, focused on AWS, Python, Scripting, Docker, Linux, Terraform and I am **AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate** Certified.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on back end heavy projects, that's where my heart lies.
